# Good Reading Bookstore API 

Welcome to the Good Reading Bookstore API Testing repository! ðŸ“š This project focuses on developing the APIs of the Good Reading Bookstore using Python and Flask library.

## Overview

In this project, we explore various endpoints of the Good Reading Bookstore API, which is built on the Bookstore schema database. Our goal is to demonstrate API testing strategies and practices using real-world examples.

## Features

**Testing Endpoints**
Explore multiple endpoints of the Good Reading Bookstore API, including:
  - Retrieve book information based on authorname
  - Create new user
  - Update new password
  - Delete account
  - Retrieve other information

## Getting Started

To get started with testing the Good Reading Bookstore API, follow these steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/nibroosauro/Rest-API-for-Bookstore-Scheme.git`.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up any required environment variables, in this repository I establish virtual environment for my program.
4. **Configure Database**: all set-up in code above only works for my database configuration. So, edit based on your configuration to avoid folly error, better watch for the global variable in `app.py` file.
4. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed to run the tests. You could just run this command on your terminal `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. **Run the Program**: Execute the provided code, just type this command `flask run`.
